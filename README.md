# Overview
This analysis seeks to offer Microsoft insight on the movie industry as it looks to find ways to penetrate the already saturated market. 

Insights are retrieved from datasets containing information on movies such as the movie directors, the year of release, the genres, domestic grossings, production budget, foreign grossing, and worldwide grossing.

From the insights in the data analyzed, Microsoft needs to invest heavily on acquiring the best directors and focusing on the genres that will guarantee the highest revenue.

# Business Understanding
- Competition in the film industry is extremely high.
- Return on investment correlates with investment in the right genres and acquisition of the right directors.
- There is no guarantee that investing in the film industry will be profitable long-term considering people have platforms like Netflix and Amazon.

# Data Understanding and Analysis
The data that was used was from several files, including:
- An IMDB database.
- TMDB movies CSV
- TN movies budget CSV
- Bom movie gross CSV.
These datasets contained data on genres, directors, foreign and domestic earnings, writers, actors, and studios. 

# Methods
This project assessed the data available, cleaned it, and visualized it in order to gain meaningful insights and to offer
informed recommendations. 

# RESULTS

This line graph seeks to showcase a relationship between production budget and return on investment on movie production. 
From the line graph, there appears to be no correlation between production budget and return on investment. Such a graphic is crucial to Microsoft as it helps to show them that other factors like the choice of director, investment in marketing, and the genre of choice impact grossings.

The bar chart above offers Microsoft an overview of its potential competition should it choose to enter the film industry. 
Some of these studios have grossed close to $50 billion dollars in the last decade and appear to not be slowing down any time soon. Therefore, this graphic is indeed crucial and offers Microsoft a clearer picture of the industry and what it will be up against if or when it decides to join the industry.


# Conclusion and Recommendations

These are the recommendation from the analysis above:
#### Work with highly experienced directors.
Directors know what the audiences want. Therefore, with the right directors, Microsoft can build a dynasty to rival the most popular movie entities. 

#### Focus on the most popular genres.
The choice of genre matters a lot. The more popular a genre is the higher the chances that more people will tune in to watch a movie. So, Microsoft needs to focus on the most popular genres. 

#### Invest in developing a great studio that can rival the current most popular and successful studios.
The studios that gross the highest happen to invest heavily in the production process. In an industry that already has established leaders, it will take Microsoft time and money to find a way to rival its potential competition. Therefore, there is need for a well-established studio.
